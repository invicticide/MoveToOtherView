# MoveToOtherView

A simple plugin for Sublime Text 2 and 3 which lets you manage a dynamic two-column window layout with a single keystroke.

* Moving the last file away from a side collapses the layout back to a single panel.

Because reasons.

* Alt+Up moves the cursor to the top line in the current view (without scrolling)
